# The Silken Web

**Silken Web** is a powerful relationship management platform designed exclusively for independent adult entertainers.

Developed by Tink — a professional dancer, writer, and content creator — the app brings sophistication, clarity, and control to patron tracking in an industry long underserved by traditional tech solutions.

The name Silken Web evokes both the intricate nature of online and real-life connections entertainers manage daily, and the refined elegance that defines high-end adult entertainment. Each “strand” in the web represents a meaningful connection — and now, every strand can be captured, organized, and nurtured with ease.

# Problem Statement

Despite the massive scale and complexity of the adult industry, entertainers still lack access to professional, tailored tech tools that reflect the reality of their work. 

Most creators rely on spreadsheets, notes apps, or their own memory to manage patrons across platforms and venues.

No CRM has ever been built to accommodate the real, nuanced needs of our world — until now.

It’s time we had tools with the polish, class, and professionalism we deserve.

# Solution

**Silken Web** provides a clean, private CRM that allows adult entertainers to:

- Log and manage patron profiles
Track custom interactions across different sites and in-person venues

- Organize Strands, the unique connections and context notes tied to each patron

- Store stage names, platform usernames, and notes in a centralized space

It’s intuitive, discreet, and tailored — finally, a system that understands the complexity of your hustle.
